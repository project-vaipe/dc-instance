    <h2><strong>About Vietnam Data Commons</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Vietnam Data Commons, powered by
      <a href="https://www.datacommons.org/">Data Commons</a>, is a joint effort
      between
      <a href="https://smarthealth.vinuni.edu.vn/"
        >VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center</a
      >
      at <a href="https://vinuni.edu.vn/">VinUniversity</a> and
      <a href="https://bkai.ai/"
        >The International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence</a
      >
      (BKAI) at
      <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/"
        >Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a
      >
      (HUST) to provide an open web-based platform to highlight Vietnam-specific
      data across various domains. It features datasets published by Vietnamese
      Ministries and governmental organizations and have been well validated
      before published. We aim to provide a comprehensive view of the country's
      social, economic, education and environmental trends through our free
      dashboards and visualization tools. Data Commons synthesizes a single
      graph from different data sources. It links references to the same
      entities (such as cities, districts, states, etc.) across different
      datasets to nodes on the graph, so that users can access data about a
      particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning
      or joining. We hope the data contained within Data Commons will be useful
      to students, researchers, and enthusiasts across different disciplines.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Who can use it?</strong></h2>
    <p>
      We believe that giving everyone easy access to data can be revolutionary â€”
      especially when it comes to solving the most challenging problems like
      climate change. Hence, Vietnam Data Commons can be accessed by anyone
      (consumers, journalists, policymakers and researchers) via the tools
      available on our official website
      <a href="http://datacommons.vn/">http://datacommons.vn/</a>. Students,
      researchers and developers can use the provided APIs, all of which are
      free for educational, academic and journalistic research purposes.
    </p>
