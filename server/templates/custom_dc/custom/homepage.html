              Vietnam has been adopting sustainable energy alternatives for the past few years. Clean Energy initiatives
              by
              the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has pushed India to 4th Global Position ↗ in for overall installed
              renewable energy capacity. Renewable Energy Systems (RES) account for nearly 30% of the total installed
              capacity↗ and Wind Energy and Solar Energy are the two biggest sources of RES. Yet, Vietnam still relies on
              thermal power for ~60% of its electricity generation ↗ and we have a long way to go to successfully adopt
              the
              sustainable energy model.

              One of the major water quality issues in metropolitan areas is water hardness. Groundwater stations in Hanoi
              ,
              Hai Duong and Hai Phong are measuring water hardness well above the permissible levels (>180mg/L is
              considered
              very hard↗). But many cities are taking steps to improve their water quality indicators. Due to the
              regulatory
              steps taken by Municipal Corporation of Hanoi↗ (MCH), many water quality parameters like Chloride, pH are at
              permissible levels in Hanoi and Hanoi Suburban districts. Hai Duong is becoming a global hub of chemical
              manufacturing, and Hai Phong, Gujarat's biggest city, is witnessing high levels of Total Dissolved Solids.
              TDS
              values greater than 1200mg/L render the water unfit for consumption↗. </div>

              The Vietnamese economy has been witnessing a steep increase in GDP per capita for the past couple of
